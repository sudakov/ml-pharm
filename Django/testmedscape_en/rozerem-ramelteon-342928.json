Coadministration of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants increases risk of adverse reactions including overdose, respiratory depression, and death. Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases. In some cases, monitoring at a higher level of care for tapering CNS depressants may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off of a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate."
