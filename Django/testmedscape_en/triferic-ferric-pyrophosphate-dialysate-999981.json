                    "In a fertility and early embryonic development study in female rats, the maternally toxic ferric pyrophosphate citrate dose of 40 mg/kg administered 3x/week by IV infusion was not toxic to the developing embryo",
                    "In embryo-fetal developmental toxicity studies, ferric pyrophosphate citrate was administered during the period of organogenesis as a 1-hr IV infusion to pregnant rats and rabbits; no maternal or developmental toxicity was observed at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day in rats and 20 mg/kg/day in rabbits",
                    "Maternally toxic doses affected embryo-fetal development, resulting in postimplantation loss due to early resorptions, abnormal placentae, decreased fetal body weight, and fetal head and vertebral malformations at 90 mg/kg/day in rats and vertebral malformations at 40 mg/kg/day in rabbits",
                    "A prenatal and postnatal development study was conducted in pregnant rats with IV doses of up to 90 mg/kg/day; the maternally toxic dose of 90 mg/kg/day resulted in reductions in the number of live offspring and lower offspring body weights",
