                "Use low potency topical corticosteroids for chronic therapy",
                "May cause local skin adverse reactions; if irritation develops, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate therapy; allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noticing a clinical exacerbation; corroborate with appropriate diagnostic patch testing",
                "If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, initiate appropriate antifungal, antibacterial, or antiviral agent; if favorable response does not occur promptly, discontinue desonide until infection controlled",
                "Use of topical corticosteroids may increase risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma",
                "Avoid contact with eyes; advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to ophthalmologist for evaluation",
                "Because of potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression; factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include use of more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, use under occlusion, use on an altered skin barrier, and use in patients with liver failure",
                "An ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression; if HPA axis suppression documented, an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw drug, to reduce frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid; manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids; recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids",
                "Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase total systemic corticosteroid exposure",
                "Local adverse reactions may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids; reactions may include skin atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria; some local adverse reactions may be irreversible"
