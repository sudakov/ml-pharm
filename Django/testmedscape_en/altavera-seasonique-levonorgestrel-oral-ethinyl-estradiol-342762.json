                "Certain conditions, such as smoking and migraine headache without aura, that do not contraindicate COC use in younger females, are contraindications to use in women over 35 years of age; women with migraine (particularly migraine/ headaches with focal neurological symptoms such as aura) who take combination oral contraceptives may be at increased risk of stroke",

                "A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins (HDL) has been reported with many progestational agents; a decline in serum high-density lipoproteins has been associated with an increased incidence of ischemic heart disease; women who are being treated for hyperlipidemias should be followed closely if they elect to use oral contraceptives; some progestogens may elevate LDL levels and may render control of hyperlipidemias more difficult; nonhormonal contraception should be considered in women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias; persistent hypertriglyceridemia may occur; elevations of plasma triglycerides may lead to pancreatitis and other complications",

                "Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users; use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease; a past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use; women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at increased risk for COC related cholestasis",

                "If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy; if pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product",
                "Women receiving therapy may experience amenorrhea, absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant; if scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider possibility of pregnancy if patient has not adhered to prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have); consider possibility of pregnancy at time of first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures; if patient has adhered to prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy"
