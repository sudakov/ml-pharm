            "Treatment of rats with 10 mcg/kg/day subcutaneously during organogenesis did not result in any reproductive toxicity, nor was it maternally toxic; at 100 mcg/kg/day after subcutaneous administration in rats, there was a decrease in fetal weights and delay in ossification, and effects on weight gain in the pregnant females",
            "It is difficult to extrapolate these doses of difluprednate to maximum daily human dose of this drug, since this drug is administered topically with minimal systemic absorption, and difluprednate blood levels were not measured in the reproductive animal studies; however, since use of this drug during human pregnancy has not been evaluated and cannot rule out the possibility of harm, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if potential benefit justifies potential risk to embryo or fetus"

                "Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local steroid application; fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid has been used or is in use; fungal culture should be taken when appropriate",
