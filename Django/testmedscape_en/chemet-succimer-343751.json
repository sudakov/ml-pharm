            "Succimer has been shown to be teratogenic and fetotoxic in pregnant mice when given subcutaneously in a dose range of 410 to 1640 mg/kg/day during period of organogenesis; in a developmental study in rats, succimer produced maternal toxicity and deaths at the dose of 720 mg/kg/day or more during organogenesis",
            "The dose of 510 mg/kg/day was the highest tolerable dose in pregnant rats; impaired development of reflexes was noted in pups of 720 mg/kg/day group dam; there are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women; therapy should be administered during pregnancy only if potential benefit justifies potential risk to fetus"

                "Mild to moderate neutropenia reported; while causal relationship to drug not definitely established, neutropenia has been reported with other drugs in same chemical class; obtain complete blood count with white blood cell differential and direct platelet counts prior to and weekly during therapy; withhold therapy or discontinue if absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is below 1200/mcL and patient followed closely to document recovery of ANC to above 1500/mcL or to patientâ€™s baseline neutrophil count; there is limited experience with reexposure in patients who have developed neutropenia; such patients should be rechallenged only if benefit of therapy clearly outweighs potential risk of another episode of neutropenia and then only with careful patient monitoring; patients treated with product should be instructed to promptly report any signs of infection; if infection suspected, the above laboratory tests should be conducted immediately",
                "Elevated blood lead levels and associated symptoms may return rapidly after discontinuation of therapy because of redistribution of lead from bone stores to soft tissues and blood; after therapy, monitor patients for rebound of blood lead levels, by measuring blood lead levels at least once weekly until stable; however, severity of lead intoxication (as measured by initial blood lead level and rate and degree of rebound of blood lead) should be used as guide for more frequent blood lead monitoring",
                "All patients undergoing treatment should be adequately hydrated; use caution in patients with compromised renal function; limited data suggests that product is dialyzable, but that the lead chelates are not",
                "Transient mild elevations of serum transaminases observed in 6-10% of patients during course of therapy; monitor serum transaminases before start of therapy and at least weekly during therapy; monitor closely patients with a history of liver disease; no data are available regarding metabolism of drugs in patients with liver disease",
                "Clinical experience with repeated courses limited; safety of uninterrupted dosing longer than three weeks not established and not recommended",
                "Possibility of allergic or other mucocutaneous reactions to drug must be borne in mind on readministration (as well as during initial courses); patients requiring repeated courses of therapy should be monitored during each treatment course; one patient experienced recurrent mucocutaneous vesicular eruptions of increasing severity affecting the oral mucosa, external urethral meatus and perianal area on the third, fourth and fifth courses of therapy; the reaction resolved between courses and upon discontinuation of therapy"
