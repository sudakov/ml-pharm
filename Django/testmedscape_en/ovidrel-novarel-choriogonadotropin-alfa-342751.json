                        "OHSS may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs; OHSS develops rapidly; therefore, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration; most often, OHSS occurs after treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment; usually, OHSS resolves spontaneously with onset of menses; if there is evidence that OHSS may be developing prior to hCG administration hCG must be withheld",
                        "If severe OHSS occurs, treatment with womens-health-reproduction#gonadotropins must be stopped and patient should be hospitalized;a physician experienced in management of this syndrome, or who is experienced in management of fluid and electrolyte imbalances should be consulted",
                        "As with other hCG products, reports of multiple births have been associated with treatment; in ART, the risk of multiple births correlates to number of embryos transferred; multiple births were experienced by 30.9% of women receiving 250 μg in the ART studies. In the ovulation induction clinical trial, 2 of 15 live deliveries (13.3%) were associated with multiple births in women receiving therapy; the patient should be advised of potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment",

                        "The early warning signs of the development of OHSS are severe pelvic pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight gain; abdominal pain, abdominal distension, gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnea, and oliguria have been reported with OHSS",

                        "Adherence to recommended dose and treatment regimen and careful monitoring of ovarian response is important to reduce risk of OHSS; if serious OHSS occurs, stop womens-health-reproduction#gonadotropins, including hCG, and consider whether woman should be hospitalized",
                        "Treatment is primarily symptomatic and overall consists of bed rest, fluid and electrolyte management, and analgesics (if needed); because the use of diuretics can accentuate diminished intravascular volume, avoid diuretics except in the late phase of resolution; initiate early consultation with a physician experienced in management of OHSS and fluid and electrolyte imbalances",
