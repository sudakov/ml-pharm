CYP450 inhibitors may inhibit enzymes involved in vitamin D metabolism (CYP24A1 and CYP27B1). This may alter serum levels of calcifediol and decrease the conversion of calcifediol to calcitriol. Dose adjustment of calcifediol may be required, and serum 25­hydroxyvitamin D, intact PTH, and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored when initiating or discontinuing a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor."
