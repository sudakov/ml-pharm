                "Neuromuscular transmission should be monitored continuously during administration and recovery with the help of a nerve stimulator; additional doses of rocuronium or any other neuromuscular blocking agent should not be given until there is a definite response (one twitch of the train-of-four) to nerve stimulation",

                "When used with other agents, occurrence of malignant hyperthermia during anesthesia is possible even in the absence of known triggering agents; clinicians should be familiar with early signs, confirmatory diagnosis and treatment of malignant hyperthermia prior to initiating any anesthetic",
                "Conditions associated with slower circulation time, eg, cardiovascular disease or advanced age, may be associated with a delay in onset time; since higher doses of rocuronium bromide injection produce longer duration of action, initial dosage should not be increased in these patients to reduce onset time; instead, when feasible, more time should be allowed for the drug to achieve onset of effect; geriatric patients (65 years or older) may be at increased risk for residual neuromuscular block",
