                "Prolonged use may also suppress the host immune response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections",
                "Routinely monitor intraocular pressure if this product is used for 10 days or longer",
                "Use caution in the presence of glaucoma; frequently check intraocular pressure",
                "Various ocular diseases and long-term use of topical corticosteroids have been known to cause corneal and scleral thinning",
                "Use of topical corticosteroids in the presence of thin corneal or scleral tissue may lead to perforation",
                "Acute purulent infections of the eye may be masked or activity enhanced by the presence of corticosteroid medication",
                "The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation",
                "Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex)",
                "Employment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution; frequent slit lamp microscopy is recommended",
                "Suspension formulation contains sodium bisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people",
                "The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low; sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people",
                "The initial prescription and renewal of medication order beyond 20 milliliters of suspension should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining; if signs and symptoms fail to improve after 2 days, the patient should be re-evaluated",
                "As fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local corticosteroid applications, fungal invasion should be suspected in any persistent corneal ulceration where a corticosteroid has been used or is in use; fungal cultures should be taken when appropriately"
