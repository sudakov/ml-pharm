                "As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use of neomycin and polymyxin B sulfates and bacitracin zinc ophthalmic ointment may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms including fungi; if superinfection occurs, appropriate measures should be initiated",
                "Bacterial resistance to neomycin and polymyxin B sulfates and bacitracin zinc ophthalmic ointment may also develop; if purulent discharge, inflammation, or pain becomes aggravated, the patient should discontinue use of the medication and consult a physician",
