                        "Given these considerations, antipsychotics should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize occurrence of tardive dyskinesia; chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and, for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate",
