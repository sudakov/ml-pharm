Polatuzumab undergoes catabolism to small peptides, amino acids, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), and unconjugated MMAE-related catabolites. MMAE is a CYP3A4 substrate. Coadministration of polatuzumab vedotin with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor may increase unconjugated MMAE AUC, which may increase polatuzumab vedotin toxicities."
