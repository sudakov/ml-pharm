                "Hypokalemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis when severe cirrhosis is present, during concomitant use of corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or after prolonged therapy; interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute to hypokalemia; hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia can provoke ventricular arrhythmias or sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis; hypokalemia may be avoided or treated by potassium supplementation or increased intake of potassium-rich foods",
                "Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction rather than salt administration, except in rare instances when hyponatremia is life-threatening; in actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is therapy of choice",
                "Calcium excretion is decreased by thiazides, and pathologic changes in parathyroid glands, with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia, have been observed in a few patients on prolonged thiazide therapy",
                "Hyperuricemia or acute gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide diuretics; bisoprolol fumarate, alone or in combination with HCTZ, has been associated with increases in uric acid; however, in U.S. clinical trials, the incidence of treatment-related increases in uric acid was higher during therapy with HCTZ 25 mg (25%) than with B/H 6.25 mg (10%); because of the very low dose of HCTZ employed, hyperuricemia may be less likely with this drug combination",

                "Continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blockers can, in some patients, precipitate cardiac failure; at the first signs or symptoms of heart failure, discontinuation of therapy should be considered; in some cases, therapy can be continued while heart failure is treated with other drugs",
                "Exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some instances, myocardial infarction or ventricular arrhythmia, are observed in patients with coronary artery disease following abrupt cessation of therapy with beta-blockers; such patients should be cautioned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without physician’s advice; even in patients without overt coronary artery disease, it may be advisable to taper therapy with over approximately 1 week with patient under careful observation; if withdrawal symptoms occur, beta-blocking agent therapy should be reinstituted,at least temporarily",
                "Beta-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease; exercise caution in such individuals",
                "Patients with bronchospastic pulmonary disease should, in general, not receive beta-blockers; because of relative beta1 selectivity of bisoprolol fumarate, the drug may be used with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or who cannot tolerate other antihypertensive treatment; Since beta1- selectivity is not absolute, the lowest possible dose of ZIAC should be used. Abeta2 agonist (bronchodilator) should be made available",
                "Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures",
                "Beta-blockers may mask some manifestations of hypoglycemia, particularly tachycardia; nonselective beta-blockers may potentiate insulin-induced hypoglycemia and delay recovery of serum glucose levels; because of its beta1-selectivity, this is less likely with bisoprolol fumarate; however, patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia, or diabetic patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, should be cautioned about these possibilities; also, latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest and diabetic patients given thiazides may require adjustment of insulin dose; because of the very low dose of HCTZ employed, this may be less likely with this drug combination",
                "Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia; abrupt withdrawal of beta-blockade may be followed by exacerbation of symptoms of hyperthyroidism or may precipitate thyroid storm",
                "Cumulative effects of thiazides may develop in patients with impaired renal function; in such patients, thiazides may precipitate azotemia; in subjects with creatinine clearance < 40 mL/min, the plasma half-life of bisoprolol fumarate is increased up to threefold, as compared to healthy subjects; if progressive renal impairment becomes apparent, therapy should be discontinued",
                "This drug combination should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease; thiazides may alter fluid and electrolyte balance, which may precipitate hepatic coma; also, elimination of bisoprolol fumarate is significantly slower in patients with cirrhosis than in healthy subjects"
