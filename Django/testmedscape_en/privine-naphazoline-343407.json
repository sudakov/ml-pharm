Based on the mechanism of action of iobenguane, drugs that reduce catecholamine uptake or that deplete catecholamine stores may interfere with iobenguane uptake into cells, and thus, reduce iobenguane efficacy. Discontinue interfering drugs for at least 5 half-lives before administration of either the dosimetry or an iobenguane dose. Do not administer these drugs until at least 7 days after each iobenguane dose."
