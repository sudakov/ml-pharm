Studies have shown that the combination of benzodiazepines and buprenorphine altered the usual ceiling effect on buprenorphine-induced respiratory depression, making the respiratory effects of buprenorphine appear similar to those of full opioid agonists. There have been postmarketing reports of coma and death with coadministration of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines. In many, but not all of these cases, buprenorphine was misused by self-injection. If a benzodiazepine must be used for an indication other than seizures, lower the benzodiazepine initial dose and cautiously titrate to clinical response."

Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases. In some cases, monitoring at a higher level of care for tapering CNS depressants may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off of a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate."
