Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary when CYP3A inhibitors are initiated in patients currently taking lumacaftor/ivacaftor. However, when initiating lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients taking strong CYP3A inhibitors, reduce the dose to 1 tablet daily (lumacaftor 200 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg total daily dose) for the first week of treatment to allow for the steady-state induction effect of lumacaftor.
