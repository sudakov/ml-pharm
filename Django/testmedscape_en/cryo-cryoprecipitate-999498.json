                "All of the factors in cryo are provided in equal or greater amounts in FFP; however the concentration is lower requiring more volume to obtain equivalent increases",
                "All transfusions must be given via blood administration sets containing 170- to 260-micron filters or 20- to 40-micron microaggregate filters unless transfusion is given via a bedside leukocyte reduction filter. No other medications or fluids other than normal saline should be simultaneously given through the same line without prior consultation with the medical director of the blood bank",
