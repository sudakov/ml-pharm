                "A number of factors reported to cause a decreased ability to respond to the tuberculin test, such as the presence of infections, viral infections (measles, mumps, chickenpox, HIV), live virus vaccinations (measles, mumps, rubella, and other live vaccines), bacterial infections (typhoid fever, brucellosis, typhus, leprosy, pertussis, overwhelming tuberculosis, tuberculous pleurisy), fungal infections (South American blastomycosis), drugs (corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents), metabolic derangements (chronic renal failure), low protein states (severe protein depletion, afibrinogenemia), age (newborns, elderly patients with waned sensitivity), stress (surgery, burns, mental illness, graft-versus-host reactions), diseases affecting lymphoid organs (Hodgkin’s disease, lymphoma, chronic leukemia, sarcoidosis), and malignancy",
                "Any condition that impairs or attenuates cell-mediated immunity potentially can cause a false negative reaction, including aging.",
                "Test results are less reliable in HIV-infected individuals as CD4 counts decline",
                "Avoid injecting tuberculin subcutaneously; if this occurs, no local reaction develops, but a general febrile reaction and/or acute inflammation around old tuberculous lesions may occur in highly sensitive individuals.",
                "The predictive value of the tuberculin skin test depends on the prevalence of infection with M. tuberculosis and the relative prevalence of cross-reactions with nontuberculous mycobacteria",
                "A separate, sterile, single-use disposable syringe and needle should be used for each individual patient to prevent possible transmission of serum hepatitis virus and other infectious agents from one person to another; special care should be taken to ensure that the product is injected intradermally and not into a blood vessel",
                "Before administration of Aplisol, review the patient’s history with respect to possible immediate-type hypersensitivity to the product, determination of previous use of the agent, and the presence of any contraindication to the test",
                "As with any biological product, epinephrine should be immediately available in case an anaphylactoid or acute hypersensitivity reaction occurs.",
                "Failure to store and handle the drug as recommended may result in a loss of potency and inaccurate test results",
                "Reactivity to the test may be depressed or suppressed for as long as 5–6 weeks in individuals following immunization with certain live viral vaccines, viral infections or discontinuation of corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents"
