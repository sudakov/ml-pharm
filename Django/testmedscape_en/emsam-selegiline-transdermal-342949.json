                "In short-term studies, antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults (<24 yr of age) taking antidepressants for major depressive disorders and other psychiatric illnesses. This increase was not seen in patients older than 24 years. A slight decrease in suicidal thinking was seen in adults older than 65 years. In children and young adults, risks must be weighed against the benefits of taking antidepressants. Patients should be monitored closely for changes in behavior, clinical worsening, and suicidal tendencies. Patients should be monitored during initial 1-2 months of therapy and during dosage adjustments. The patientâ€™s family should communicate any abrupt changes in behavior to the healthcare provider. Worsening behavior and suicidal tendencies that are not part of the presenting symptoms may require discontinuation of therapy. This drug is not approved for use in pediatric patients",
