                "Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure",
                "In Patients Without a history of cardiac failure continued depression of myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure; at first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, therapy should be discontinued",
                "Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) of mild or moderate severity, bronchospastic disease, or a history of bronchospastic disease (other than bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, in which timolol is contraindicated) should, in general, not receive beta-blockers",
                "Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents; beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia",
                "Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism; patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents that might precipitate thyroid storm",
                "Because of potential effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents on blood pressure and pulse, these agents should be used with caution in patients with cerebrovascular insufficiency; if signs or symptoms suggesting reduced cerebral blood flow develop following initiation of therapy, alternative therapy should be considered",
                "There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products; these containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of ocular epithelial surface",

                "In patients with angle-closure glaucoma, the immediate objective of treatment is to reopen the angle; this requires constricting the pupil; timolol maleate has little or no effect on the pupil; timolol should not be used alone in the treatment of angle-closure glaucoma",
                "While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens; such patients may be unresponsive to usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions",
                "Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness); timolol has been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms",
