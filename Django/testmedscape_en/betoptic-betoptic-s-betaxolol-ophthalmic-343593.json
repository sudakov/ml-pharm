                "As with many topically applied ophthalmic drugs, this drug is absorbed systemically; same adverse reactions found with systemic administration of beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors may occur with topical administration; that includes severe respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions, including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and death due to cardiac failure, reported with topical application of beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors",
                "Beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors should be administered with caution in patients subject to hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents; beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia",
                "Beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors may mask certain clinical signs (eg, tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism; patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors, which might precipitate a thyroid storm",
                "Beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (eg, diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness)",
                "Exercise caution in the treatment of glaucoma patients with excessive restriction of pulmonary function; there have been reports of asthmatic attacks and pulmonary distress during betaxolol treatment",
                "Although rechallenges of some such patients with ophthalmic betaxolol have not adversely affected pulmonary function test results, the possibility of adverse pulmonary effects in patients sensitive to beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors cannot be ruled out",
                "While taking beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors, patients with history of atopy or history of severe anaphylactic reaction to variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens; such patients may be unresponsive to usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions",
                "In patients with angle-closure glaucoma, immediate treatment objective is to reopen the angle; this may require constricting the pupil; therapy has little or no effect on pupil and should not be used alone in treatment of angle-closure glaucoma",
                "Because of potential effects of beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors on blood pressure and pulse, these inhibitors should be used with caution in patients with vascular insufficiency; if signs or symptoms suggesting reduced cerebral blood flow or Raynaudâ€™s phenomenon develop following initiation of therapy with this drug, alternative therapy should be considered",
                "Bacterial keratitis may occur with use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products when these containers are inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface; instruct patients on appropriate instillation techniques",
                "Choroidal detachment after filtration procedures reported with administration of aqueous suppressant therapy",
                "The preservative benzalkonium chloride may be absorbed by soft contact lenses; contact lenses should be removed during instillation of the drug but may be reinserted 15 minutes after instillation"
