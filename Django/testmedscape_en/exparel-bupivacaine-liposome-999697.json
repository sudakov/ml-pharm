                "Injection of multiple doses of bupivacaine and other amide-containing products may cause significant increases in plasma concentrations with each repeated dose due to slow accumulation of the drug or its metabolites, or slow metabolic degradation; tolerance to elevated blood concentrations varies with the status of the patient",
                "Allergic-type reactions are characterized by signs such as urticaria, pruritus, erythema, angioneurotic edema (including laryngeal edema), tachycardia, sneezing, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, syncope, excessive sweating, elevated temperature, and possibly anaphylactoid-like symptoms (including severe hypotension); cross-sensitivity among members of the amide-type local anesthetic group reported; the usefulness of screening for sensitivity has not been definitively established",
                "Because amide-type local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine, are metabolized by the liver, use cautiously with hepatic disease; greater risk for toxic plasma concentrations with severe hepatic disease",
