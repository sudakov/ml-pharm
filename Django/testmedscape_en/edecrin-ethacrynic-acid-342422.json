                "Effects on electrolytes are related to its renal pharmacologic activity and are dose dependent; the possibility of profound electrolyte and water loss may be avoided by weighing the patient throughout the treatment period, by careful adjustment of dosage, by initiating treatment with small doses, andby using the drug on an intermittent schedule when possible",
                "When excessive diuresis occurs, the drug shouldbe withdrawn until homeostasis restored; when excessive electrolyte loss occurs, the dosage should bereduced or the drug temporarily withdrawn",
                "Initiation of diuretic therapy with this drug in the cirrhotic patient with ascites is best carried out in hospital; when maintenance therapy has been established, the individual can be satisfactorily followed as an outpatient",

                "Too vigorous a diuresis, as evidenced by rapid and excessive weight loss, may induce an acute hypotensive episode; in elderly cardiac patients, rapid contraction of plasma volume and the resultant hemoconcentration should be avoided to prevent development of thromboembolic episodes, such as cerebral vascular thromboses and pulmonary emboli which may be fatal",
                "Excessive loss of potassium in patients receiving digitalis glycosides may precipitate digitalis toxicity; care should be exercised in patients receiving potassium-depleting steroid",
                "A number of possibly drug-related deaths have occurred in critically ill patients refractory to other diuretics; these generally have fallen into two categories: patients with severe myocardial disease who have been receiving digitalis and presumably developed acute hypokalemia with fatal arrhythmia and patients with severely decompensated hepatic cirrhosis with ascites, with or without accompanying encephalopathy, who were in electrolyte imbalance and died because of intensification of electrolyte defect",
                "Deafness, tinnitus, and vertigo with a sense of fullness in the ears have occurred, most frequently in patients with severe impairment of renal function; these symptoms have been associated most often with intravenous administration and with doses in excess of those recommended; the deafness has usually been reversible and of short duration (one to 24 hours); however, in some patients the hearing loss has been permanent",
                "A number of these patients were also receiving drugs known to be ototoxic; this drug may increase ototoxic potential of other drugs",
                "Weakness, muscle cramps, paresthesias, thirst, anorexia, and signs of hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and/or hypochloremic alkalosis may occur following vigorous or excessive diuresis and these may be accentuated by rigid salt restriction; rarely, tetany has been reported following vigorous diuresis; during therapy with ethacrynic acid, liberalization of salt intake and supplementary potassium chloride are often necessary",
                "When metabolic alkalosis may be anticipated, eg, in cirrhosis with ascites, use of potassium chloride or a potassium-sparing agent before and during therapy may mitigate or prevent hypokalemia",

                "Orthostatic hypotension may occur in patients receiving other antihypertensive agents when given this drug has little or no effect on glomerular filtration or on renal blood flow, except following pronounced reductions in plasma volume when associated with rapid diuresis; a transient increase in serum urea nitrogen may occur; usually, this is readily reversible when the drug is discontinued",
