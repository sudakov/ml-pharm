Strong CYP3A inhibitors do not impact lumacaftor exposure, but increased ivacaftor exposure by 4.3-fold. Due to the induction effect of lumacaftor on CYP3A, at steady-state the net exposure of ivacaftor is not expected to exceed that when given in the absence of lumacaftor at a dose of 150 mg q12hr (the approved dose of ivacaftor monotherapy). Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary when CYP3A inhibitors are initiated in patients currently taking lumacaftor/ivacaftor. However, when initiating lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients taking strong CYP3A inhibitors, reduce the dose to 1 tablet daily (lumacaftor 200 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg total daily dose) for the first week of treatment to allow for the steady-state induction effect of lumacaftor. Following this period, continue with the recommended daily dose. No dose adjustment is required for moderate or weak CYP3A4 inhibitors."
