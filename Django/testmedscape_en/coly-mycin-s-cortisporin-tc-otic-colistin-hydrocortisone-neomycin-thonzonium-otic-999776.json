                "When using neomycin-containing products to control secondary infection in the chronic dermatoses, such as chronic otitis externa or stasis dermatitis, it should be borne in mind that the skin in these conditions is more liable than is normal skin to become sensitized to many substances, including neomycin",
                "The manifestation of sensitization to neomycin is usually alow-grade reddening with swelling, dry scaling, and itching; it may be manifest simply as a failure to heal",
                "Periodic examination for such signs is advisable, and the patient should be told to discontinue the product if they are observed; these symptoms regress quickly on withdrawing the medication; neomycin containing applications should be avoided for the patient thereafter",
                "As with any other antibiotic preparation, prolonged treatment may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms and fungi; if the infection is not improved after one week, cultures should be repeated to verify the identity of the organism and to determine whether therapy should be changed",
                "Treatment should not be continued for longer than ten days",
