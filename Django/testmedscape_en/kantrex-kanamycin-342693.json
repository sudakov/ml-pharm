                "Neurotoxicity, manifested as both bilateral auditory and vestibular ototoxicity, can occur in patients with preexisting renal damage and in patients with normal renal function treated at higher doses and/or for periods longer than those recommended. High-frequency deafness usually occurs first and can be detected only by audiometric testing. Vertigo may occur and may be evidence of vestibular injury",

If blockage occurs, calcium salts may reverse these phenomena, but mechanical respiratory assistance may be necessary",
                "Avoid concurrent or sequential use of neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drugs including other antimicrobials#aminoglycosides (eg, amikacin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, puromomycin",

Avoid potent diuretics (eg, ethacrynic acid, furosemide) because they increase risk of ototoxicity. When administered intravenously, diuretics may enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue"
